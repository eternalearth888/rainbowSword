# Progress Update

## What we've got done
- A sword model, that can change color based on input
- A radial menu that tracks the mouse location 
- Our title screen
- Character helmet is modeled in Blender

## Our next steps
- Integrate radial menu with sword
- Finish our character's model, move into Unity
- Start work on animations (character movement, sword swinging)
- Create a basic level to progress through
- Create VERY basic enemies to fight, include basic AI

## Moving Forward
Our primary overarching goal to achieve by the end of break is to have some semblance of a playable game: movement, attacking, enemies to attack, and a world to attack them in. So far, we've been focused on creating the radial menu, the rainbow sword, and the main character's helmet design. We started out with these mostly because we thought them to be the most important parts of our game's core idea, but it's clear that there's still a game to be made. We're excited to have a playable game come December!

# Bo’s Key Features

## Physical Features:
Gender-ambiguous & minimal
Has a majestic cape! Cape acts as “moral tracker”
Space Paladin
Weird-shaped helmet (thinking Crescent for now, may change)
Wields the Chroma Blade
![helmet]("helmet 2019_11_20.png")

## Dominant Traits:
Stoic: Character is silent and somewhat lacking emotion, rarely expressing happiness, fear, doubt or regret. Character remains stoic in the face of the dangers they encounter. 
Gentle: Character will have the option to avoid fighting, and “defeat” enemies in ways besides combat. Character has the option to avoid harming.

## Backstory:
Bo, the guardian of the infamous Chroma Blade, has lost their power. The sword’s gems, from which it draws its power, have been dispersed across the stars, and the blade is a mere fragment of what it ought to be. Bo must reclaim these gems alone, to atone for their failure to protect them. And by Bo’s might alone will the Chroma Blade be restored!

## Emotion/Personality:
Bo is essentially a “blank slate,” and their behavior in the game will alter the player’s opinion of them. They are intended to have relatively little emotional expression, and little personality; such that the colors the player makes use of the most will alter their impression of Bo. For example, extensive use of Red (what we consider to be an “evil” color) will display Bo as a vicious villain; whereas extensive use of Green displays Bo as a kind & peaceful hero. As the player progresses & uses the different colors, good and evil colors can offset each other, potentially reverting Bo to their original, neutral self.
