#### Screens
##### Radial Subscreen
- Allows you to choose colors
- Choices are :
	- Just black 
	- Just white
		- All colors are activated for a limited amount of time
- Allow the player to choose one color for now 

If we have time to allow for color combos, players will be forced to choose 3 colors, where 1 of them is black/white and the other two are “whatever” combo they choose

#### Map Possibilities
- Tower battle(?) 
	- Start at the bottom to top
- Go wherever you like
		- Open world with scaling for enemies so player doesn’t become too weak or too strong in certain areas
