## GAME IDEA!

#### Game Name
Chroma Blade
#### Game Summary
Chroma Blade is a hack-and-slash RPG that puts the player's mastery of color to the test. Weilding a powerful chromatic sword, they must switch between the different colors of the rainbow tactically in order to defeat their foes. Each color has its own unique mechanic, each being crucial in the defeat of the variety of enemies the player will face as they progress through the game. The game is divided into color-themed areas, each with a final boss that contains one of the Chroma Blade's color powers- start with a blank, black sword, and unlock all of the six colors to achieve victory. The colors may be unlocked in any order: using enough "evil" color or enough "good" color will alter the game's ending, so choose wisely!
